                            <h4>Adolescence</h4>
                            
                            <p>At the age of 12 I joined Air Cadets.
                            While there I didn't learn leadership, discipline, and self reliance,
                            I only strengthen those qualities I already had,
                            providing the foundation for the strong entrepreneurial attitude I have today.
                            </p>
                            <p>By the age of 15 I was working a consistent part-time job while still attending high school, cadets and actively participating in extra curricular sports such a Basketball and Track and Field.
                            By then I had made the rank of sergeant and was regularly teaching classes on survival, drill, the principles of flight and related topics.
                            </p>
                            <p>At the age of 17 I received my private pilots license, through cadets before I had my G1.
                            While in school, I went to OFSSA three times for discuss and shot put,
                            consistently placing in the top 6 across all of Ontario each year.
                            </p>
                            <p>Before the age of 20, I had already travelled to, most notably
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Toronto-ON</li>

                                    <li>San Andreas-Columbia</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div>
                            <h4>College Life</h4>
                            <p>Shortly after my 20th birthday, I moved to London to attend Video Game Design and Development at TriOS college.
                            </p>
                            <p>Within my first few months there I developed a C++ poker hashing algorithm and evaluator as my first major coding project.
                            When finished, my project outperformed that of my instructor,
                            which he would eagerly brag about to his colleagues, earning me recognition across campuses.
                            </p>
                            <p>The game implemented the 5 most common types of poker games,
                            leveraging fundamental principles of number theory and static programming techniques to execute,
                            analyse and compare hands of cards at a nearly instant time complexity.
                            This project is still my proudest accomplishment from that time,
                            however the project source is not planned to be available any time soon.
                            </p>
                            <p>After that, my most notable projects were developing prototypes for a 3D DirectX-10 role playing game which loaded levels and basic models (saved as markup) and had a primitive combat system and UI (which would later result in the basis for an entire graphics engine),
                            and two C# XNA titles which included a mincraft-esque farming simulator with real time xml editing tools (for level development) and a space-flight shooter featuring upgrade-able weapons of various types (including laser cannons, photon-torpedoes and proximity mines) for Xbox 360.
                            </p>
                            <p>I also attended the Great Canadian App-athon in 2011 and 2012,
                            which was a 72 hour coding contest involving all colleges and universities across Canada.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>By this point I was nearing the end of my college career and regularly working 16-18 hours a day (sometime even periods of 48 hours or more) to meet my school work load,
                            while also pursuing my own side projects,
                            which would include an interest in cryptography,
                            but more importantly I would teach myself Python in the hopes of adapting a bulky and cumbersome C++ template meta-programming markup language serialization library into a more elegant solution in Python,
                            After that the goal then was to write a C++ application with the interpreter embedded within it,
                            to leverage the added flexibility and modularity of Python.
                            </p>
                            <p>The advent of a functioning markup language parser lead to the formalization of a written standard of the markup language I personally developed to address many issues I had personally with both xml and json formats. I would then go on to include these component with my larger 3D Direct-X engine to facilitate serialization of dynamic game objects created through the level editor.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <div>
                            <h4>Post College</h4>
                            <p>After graduation, I started an unpaid internship as an iOS/Objective-C modile developer at <a href="">Sky Orchard Studios</a>, formerly Seremeres Games.
                            </p>
                            <p>During the internship I also supported myself through working full time for a temp agency at the LCBO warehouse outside London.
                            This required working 16 hours a day at 2 separate jobs for four months straight until I was hired to continue working as an iOS developer.
                            </p>
                            </p>As it was a small independent studio,
                            As the sole developer on all their projects (with the owner/CEO being the artist),
                            I played all roles from lead developer (including writing shell script build tools and photoshop scripts),
                            to QA tester and Research and Development.
                            I was also responsible for all aspects of the life cycle of multiple built target applications which implemented a diverse toolchain.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Within my first year, roughly 10 applications had either been released or updated,
                                to which the most successful app currently has over 3.5 million downloads and continues to be the foundation of Sky Orchard Studio's success.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>Unfortunately, near the end of my employment with Sky Orchard Studios, I would suffer a devastating personal loss,
                            With all of my personal hardware being stolen from my apartment.
                            This effectively resulted in the lost of all my projects, notes, source code, examples and entire life's work up to that point,
                            causing a devastating professional set back, which, to this day, I still have not fully recovered from.
                            </p>

                            <p>Going back to the temp agency after the contract with Sky Orchard expired, I would take on various manual labour roles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            After several months working in a factory,
                            I would finally get the opportunity to recover from the theft of my hardware,
                            being able to purchase a laptop for a job as a web developer working for 8.5:1 Entertainment.
                            </p>
                            <p>At that point I quickly taught myself javascript, html, css, php, and mySQL while on the job.</p>
                            <p>While there I worked closely with 1 other dedicated developer and a small group of and 2-5 interns updating an Actionscript base web application to HTML5.
                            </p>
                            <p>As a senior team member, I primarily supervised the interns assisting in their tasks,
                            while simultaneously working on my own.
                            </p>
                            <p>The company would collapse before the product could launch, following a series of poor and selfish decisions by the owner.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>Then I went on to find employment at my former college, TriOS, teaching the very course I had once taken.
                            </p>
                            <p>Shortly after beginning my new job, I became a father of a amazing son.
                            </p>
                            <p>While at TriOS, I worked 10-16 hours teaching 2 separate classes a day and was responsible for managing groups between 4-12 students at a time,
                            lecturing on the software production life-cycle and the foundations of computer programming, software development and video game design,
                            with the course's primary focus being on Unity/C#, Xcode/Swift, Win32/DirectX-11, and mobile/web development using HTML and javascript.
                            </p>

                            <p>In my free time, I would begin pursuing a side project in WebGL,
                            in the hopes of sharing my knowledge of graphics programming with my students (and the world) by developing exciting,
                            easy to use, interactive examples and tools for WebGL,
                            while also working towards building a minimalist graphics engine for the web.
                            </p>
                            <p>After working a year at TriOS, I decided to leave to be a stay-at-home father to raise and teach my, by then, 1 year old son,
                            while my spouse went back to both college and work after taking time off and we waited for our son to be accepted into a childcare program.

                        <div>
                            <h4>Recently</h4>
                            <p>As of today, roughly 6 years after graduating college,
                            I am fluent in over 10 programming, scripting, shading or markup languages and
                            recently began teaching myself Solidity, for programming cryptocurrency smart-contracts on the Ethereum blockchain,
                            as well as TensorFlow for Machine Learning,
                            React for web UI development and NodeJS for back-end server development.
                            </p>
                            <p>However, with the many projects currently under development across multiple platforms (see projects page),
                            it has become quite time consuming for a single developer to work on and maintain all of them (even with appropriate software tools for minimizing workflow overhead),
                            thus I have opened up several open-source repositories for several of the more complete ones,
                            in hopes of attracting interest from other developers or potential employers,
                            while also allowing me to focus on newer, more significant and complex projects.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Integer Sequences</h3>
                            <p>In number theory, there are many common sequences which are highly prevalent in nature,
                            such as the Primes or Fibonacci Numbers,
                            with many having intimate ties to more complex fields of science and math, such as cryptography.
                            Yet, many common languages lack built-in support for generating such sequences.
                            </p>
                            <p>This project seeks to remedy this by offering a standardized API, which is shared across multiple platforms.</p>
                            <p>
                            The Integer Sequence Library projects are based off the <a href="http://oeis.org/">Online Encyclopaedia of Integer Sequences</a>.
                            Unlike some APIs which simply grab the binary file from the OEIS, then serialize them directly into objects,
                            this library, rather than depending on an internet connection and then parsing a text/binary file,
                            allows for native platform support for generating common integer sequences,
                            allowing for much more power and speed as it does away with
                                <ul>
                                    <li>dependency upon an established internet connection(if no connection or website is down, no functionality)</li>
                                    <li>does not need to wait for server responses(sending, receiving and processing http requests takes time)</li>
                                    <li>does not need to parse server response into native data (data is already generated natively)</li>
                                    <li>does not need to make multiple requests to the server to generate multiple or varying iterations of a sequences,
                                    as typically a static series can be generated just once on start-up and used indefinitely while the application runs
                                    </li>
                                    <li>developers do not need to worry about buffer overflows(receiving too much data from server, blowing the stack) or receiving data which does not support native data-type sizes (either to large or too small of values or the wrong data type entirely)</li>
                                </ul>
                                All of these are major drawbacks and are associated with major overhead,
                                none of which are present when generating native sequences using these libraries.

                            or any other customer loyalty systems which rewards users with unique currencies which can't be deemed for legal tender?
                            How about laundry machines that accept reloadable chip-cards, or the wristbands/access passes at amusement parks?
                            Then you are already using cryptocurrencies and don't even know it!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The only difference with Ethereum is the decentralized nature of the system, with the currency exists entirely ephemerally within the distributed blockchain.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Where corporate conglomerates or banking syndicates maintain sole control of the traditional systems their users/consumers access,
                            with Ethereum anyone and everyone can effectively create their own financial system, lending institution, auction house, currency exchange, crowd funding campaign, or entirely secure democratic organizations
                            without ever having to rely on a third party banking institutes or having to be dependant upon payment systems such as PayPal or Amazon,
                            which can chose to shutdown user accounts for no reason, without any notice,
                            effectively halting all future financial transactions.
                            </p>
                            <p>With Ethereum, power is entirely in the hands of individual users,
                            rather than the faceless multi-national financial institutions or corporations which horde their capital (at the expense of the public),
                            or governments, which would gladly seize private assets to bail out failing business or to serve their own agendas (see <a href="">Bail-Ins</a>, <a href="">Civil Forfeiture</a>, <a href="">Eminent Domain</a> or the Greece financial crisis).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            With all transactions being recorded publicly in the blockchain.
                            </p>
                            <p>Ethereum is truly the future of finance, set to disrupt many traditional institutions through decentralization.
                            </p>
