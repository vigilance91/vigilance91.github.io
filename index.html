                    where one does not simply passively observe the written word in a static order, like books.
                    Instead, users are driven by countless interactions,
                    where each experience has the potential to be new and unique.

                    <p>Experienced with both DirectX and OpenGL, I have a deep passion for graphics programming.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>While conventionally used for rendering geometry to a screen, producing various visual effects,
                    this field expands vastly beyond that single application.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>At its core, graphics programming is the off-loading of algorithms from the CPU (central processing unit) onto a computer's GPU (graphic processing unit).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>GPUs were designed to leverage the immense power of asynchronous processing, without the need for synchronization primitives,
                    such as locks, mutexes or semaphores.
                        <p class='note'>While superior in terms of raw processing power,
                        this architecture does pose several drawbacks, however.
                        The primary one being, graphics processors can <b>not</b> implement a call stack<sup><a href="">[citation required]</a></sup>,
                        preventing certain techniques such as <a href="">recursion</a>,
                        which relies on a functional programming technique where,
                        where a method calls itself until a terminating condition is met or,
                        the stack is blown, resulting in very <b>bad</b> things happening.
                        <br>
                        The second being, any data submitted as input to the graphics pipeline is immutable.
                        Any operations performed on constants or buffers is unable to persist the state change beyond the current execution,
                        thus can not be subsequently accessed by the CPU code via the resource handle afterwards.
                        Instead, unique buffers must be separately bound to the pipeline for independent input and output operations (whoever, HLSL 5 introduced read/write textures/buffers).
                        As a result, typically the mapping of resources from the graphics card's RAM into conventional RAM is <b>not</b> allowed for those resources currently bound to the pipeline while rendering.
                        </p>
                    Their thousands of dedicated cores and their optimized instruction sets targeting vector, matrix, color math as well as accelerated and asynchronous access of indexed buffers allows
                    GPU programs (colloquially called <b><i>shaders</i></b>) have the ability to process large quantities of data in parallel.
                    This allows for significantly faster processing compared to the serial nature of processing the same data on a CPU.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note'>When appropriately leveraged with Multi-tasking or Multi-processing on the CPU,
                    execution can be increased by utilizing techniques such as background loading of resources,
                    or processing of i/o operations separately from the primary rendering logic.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Two of the most common applications of graphics programming in industry are in the fields of <a href="">artificial intelligence</a> and <a href="">cryptocurrencies</a>,
                    where highly computational intensive operations such as <a href="">machine learning</a> and <a href="">mining transaction blocks</a>, respectfully,
                    can be more efficiently performed with significantly higher output capacity than would be possible on a conventional 2 or 4 core processor alone,
                    with modern GPUs produced with literally hundreds (if not thousands) of cores.

                    <h3 class='text-center'>Integer Sequences Libraries</h3>
                    <p>In number theory, there are many common sequences which are highly prevalent in nature,
                    such as the Primes or Fibonacci Numbers,
                    with many having intimate ties to more complex fields of science and math, such as cryptography.
                    Yet, many common languages lack built-in support for generating such sequences.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>This project seeks to remedy this by offering a standardized API, which is shared across multiple platforms.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>The Integer Sequence Library projects are based off the <a href="http://oeis.org/">Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>.
                    Unlike some APIs which simply grab the binary file from the OEIS, then serialize them directly into objects,
                    this library, rather than depending on an Internet connection and then parsing a text/binary file,
                    allows for native platform support for generating common integer sequences,
                    allowing for much more power and speed as it does away with
                        <ul>
                            <li>*dependency upon an established Internet connection(if no connection or website is down, no functionality).</li>
                            <li>*does not need to wait for server responses(sending, receiving and processing http requests takes time).</li>
                            <li>*does not need to parse server response into native data (data is already generated natively).</li>
                            <li>*does not need to make multiple requests to the server to generate multiple or varying iterations of a sequences,
                            as typically a static series can be generated just once on start-up and used indefinitely while the application runs.
                            </li>
                            <li>*developers do not need to worry about buffer overflows (receiving too much data from server, blowing the stack) or,
                            receiving data which does not support native data-type sizes (either to large or too small of values or the wrong data type entirely).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>All of these are major drawbacks and are associated with major overhead,
                        none of which are present when generating native sequences using these libraries.
                        Many sequence interfaces included in these libraries provide iterative and recursive alternatives (plus generators in languages that support them).
                        </p>
                        
                        <p class='note'>While generally, the recursive versions are not recommended (due to stack depth restrictions),
                        in some cases the recursive functions can be faster,
                        such as operating on sets guaranteed to hold only a few numbers of elements or when implemented using static programming techniques.
                        At worse, an exception is generally thrown (and caught) if abuse occurs,
                        outputting a message for developers.

                    <p>Dating back to the first documented mechanized counting device,
                    created by the French child prodigy <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Blaise-Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a>
                    (excluding the recent discovery of the ancient and mysterious Greek marvel,
                    the <a href="">Antikythera mechanism</a>,
                    used to calculate the dates of astrolgoical phenomena, including Eclipses and the Olympiad),
                    all computers have been designed to make human processes easier (such as computing mathematical equations).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Robotic process automation can then be described as the mechanical emulation of collections of tasks, with little or no intervention.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Expanding on the definition of computing (simply as the execution of instruction sets),
                    RPA technology provides the ability for machines to reproduce complex (often time consuming) interactions with programs (typically through scripted GUI actions),
                    in a manner which is more convenient for individuals and more cost effective for businesses.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>With RPA technology, mundane and repetitive tasks such as,
                    downloading pdf invoices from an email account sent by a specific client then archiving the files or,
                    scrapping a website for data then entering it into a spreadsheet, can be significantly hastened,
                    thus reducing the associated overhead and increasing productivity.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Since automated processes are significantly faster than a human performing the same task,
                    it is only natural that developers designing, reusable automated workflows are more valuable assets to a business,
                    than the alternative of continually paying employee wages and benefits for work which can be performed by computers.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Just like the advent of the industrial revolution saw slow, hazardous and expensive human labour replaced by (relatively) cheap steam powered machines,
                    the technological revolution of the 21st century will see more and more
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note'>Not all process can be automated. Although, with advances in AI technology, that gap is closing fast.</p>

                    <summary>Quantum Computing</summary>
                    <p>Leveraging the powers of the fundamental principles of the universe,
                    quantum computers operate on the probabilistic laws of <a href="">Quantum Mechanics</a>,
                    in contrast to conventional computers, operating via (and limited by) Electromagnetism.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Where traditional graphical applications run vector and matrix algebra for the transformation and rendering of vertices,
                    quantum computers operate similarly, by the application of 2x2 matrices of complex numbers (often referred to as <i>gates</i>),
                    which when applied to a qubit, alters its properties (or rather, the wave function) when observed.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>When being measured, the qubit's wave function collapses, resulting in a value of either 1(true) or 0(false).
                    When not being measured, the qubit is in a indeterminate state,
                    occupying all possibilities, simultaneously.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note'>Like wise with 8, 16 and 32 bit, etc, conventional processors,
                    introducing multiple qubits creates more complex and powerful programs.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note'>Be aware, there is a difference between quantum computing and an actual, fully fledged quantum computer.
                    Where all that is need to execute quantum programs is a Quantum Processing Unit (much like a conventional CPU),
                    a full quantum computer has all of it corresponding conventional counterpart replaced with quantum analogues,
                    such as quantum RAM or storage.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Mathematical Representation</h4>
                    <p>Most commonly, quantum gates take the form of <a href="">Pauli Matrices</a>.
                    Similar to matrix algebra, quantum operations are performed, typically, through the composition of two or more of the 3 Pauli matrices.
                    Other common gates include phase shift and gates.
                        <p class='note'>The identity matrix(also expressed as the Kronecker delta) is considered the zeroth Pauli matrix.</p>
                    What is truly interesting about the math behind quantum computing (as a branch of complex mathematics) is that,
                    while its principles have been laid out and well understood since by mathematicians for centuries,
                    it was widely held that complex mathematics (while weird and interesting), held no practical application in the real world,
                    until the relatively recent advances in science in the early 20th century regarding fields such as electromagnetism, sub-atomic particle physics and the foundation of quantum mechanics itself.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Not only does complex algebra accurately and conveniently describe the nature of light and other natural phenomena,
                    Pauli matrices (and their various combinations) also give the most concise mathematical expression of quarks (the building blocks of protons, neutrons and their antimatter counter parts),
                    as represented by the the most modern understanding of string theory.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Conceptualization</h4>
                    <p>At its most rudimentary conception, gates can be conceived of in a similar manner to polarized lenses,
                    which cause light to be filtered (or rather, collapse its wave function),
                    dependent upon the photon's electromagnetic charge (expressed as a complex number) and the lens' polarization.
                    Depending upon the light entering, photons will either pass the lens (representing a logical value of true/1) if parallel to the polarization or,
                    will not pass through (representing a logical value of false/0) if it is orthogonal to the polarization.
                    When the charge of a photon is at an angle not parallel or orthogonal to the polarization,
                    since quantum states can only be expressed with whole number coefficients,
                    interacting with the lens causes the photon to "decide", based on its wave function,
                    to collapse and become 1 or 0, passing or being absorbed by the filter respectively.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Observing qubits and performing operations in quantum programs follows the same principle.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><h4>Example</h4>
                    One of the most fundamental cases for a single qubit program is for representing flipping a coin,
                    where each outcome has a 50-50 chance of occurring.
                        <p class='note'>This is an ideal system, where all external factors (such as wind resistance, ambient temperature and pressure, etc) and,
                        any unlikely outcomes such as the coin landing on its side or any number of other indeterminate states are not taken into consideration.
                        </p>
                    By applying a (..) gate, when the qubit is measured, it will have a 50% probability of being either 1 or 0,
                    with the results almost always creating an even distribution of alternating 0's and 1's.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note'>This effect is significantly different on a conventional computer,
                    where true randomness is incredibly difficult to emulate.
                    Instead, generating pseudo-random numbers can produce close results however,
                    there will always be an underlying pattern (based on the algorithm used),
                    thus creating an even distribution of probabilist outcomes is almost impossible without various inherent biases or emergent patterns.
                    </p>

                    <p class='note'>Cryptocurrency should not simply be referred to as <i>crypto</i> (despite the allure),

                    <p>These fundamental aspects make cryptocurrency and blockchain technology incredibly powerful.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Cryptocurrency networks are supported by miners which verify transactions using a consensus mechanism.
                    This mechanism ensures all nodes agree that a transaction happened and is valid,
                    which prevents dishonesty by one node fraudulently attempting to modify the blockchain.

                    <p>With the blockchain distributed across all machines participating on the network,
                    targeting a single node for exploitation, effectively renders common malicious techniques,
                    such as DDoS attacks, ineffective at worst and obsolete at best,
                    since disruption of any one network participant has little to no effect on the capacity of the network to operate as a whole,
                    combined with the distributed nature of the blockchain, any malicious actions on a single node will have no effect on the network as a whole,
                    with any blocks which are deemed to be invalid under the consensus mechanism discarded and ignored.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note'>There are, however, other forms of attacks on decentralized networks,
                    such as the infamous 51% attack,
                    where if a single actor controls at least 51% of the nodes on any network,
                    they effectively control the consensus mechanism of that network,
                    by deciding which transaction are valid and which are not.

                    <p class='note'>While Ethereum technically falls under the umbrella term of cryptocurrency,
                    this may be a slight misnomer as it is clearly stated on the foundation's <a href="">website</a> that it is explicitly <b>NOT</b> intended as a form of currency,
                    but rather as a medium of power to facilitate transactions on the network and reward miners for their contribution of processing blocks,
                    much like gasoline is used to power a car to facilitate the movement of people and goods.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note'>This if further supported by the Canadian government's determination that Ethereum is <b>not</b> a <b>currency</b> nor a <b>security</b>,
                    but rather a vehicle by which barter transactions are carried out between individuals.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>For example, while conventional currency (an intermediary vector of abstract value backed only by society's precieved need to facilitate trade)
                    may be used to purchase gasoline (a physical vector of potential work energy) to operate a car,
                    one can not simply inject currency into an internal-combustion engine to have it operate (although paper money does burn) likewise,
                    petrol is not legal tender, thus can not be used legitimately as a direct medium for exchanging goods and services,
                    without first exchanging it for fiat currency by selling it on the open market.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>While most people new to the world of cryptocurrency typically get quickly overwhelmed with the many unfamiliar or foreign concepts,
                    it is much less intimidating once coming to the realization that, in many ways,
                    the concept of expressing value with digital assets is actually already employed ubiquitously in the everyday life of the modern world.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Do you take advantage of Credit cards with reward points or,
                    any other customer loyalty systems which awards users unique currencies which can't be redeemed for legal tender?
                    How about laundry machines that accept reloadable chip-cards or, wristbands/access passes at amusement parks?
                    Then you are already using cryptocurrencies and didn't know it!
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Just like rewards points from credit-cards and corporate loyalty programs,
                    Ethereum and related technologies are not currencies, yet can still be used to acquire goods and services,
                    much like using rewards points may allow for the purchase of goods or services,
                    without the direct use of currency.</p>
                    
                    <p>The only difference with Ethereum is the decentralized nature of the system,
                    existing entirely ephemerally within the distributed blockchain,
                    as opposed to a centralized server, owned by a single entity.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Where corporate conglomerates or banking syndicates maintain sole control of the traditional systems their users/consumers access,
                    with Ethereum anyone and everyone can effectively create their own
                        <ul>
                            <li>financial system</li>
                            <li>lending institution</li>
                            <li>auction house</li>
                            <li>currency exchange</li>
                            <li>charity or non-profit organization</li>
                            <li>crowd funding campaign</li>
                            <li>casino or lottery</li>
                            <li>contracts representing property ownership (referred to as non-fungible tokens), including royalties or company stocks (these tokens may be subject to securities regulations)</li>
                            <li>entirely secure and transparent democratic organizations</li>
                        </ul>
                    all without ever having to rely on third party banking institutions, credit card companies or having to be dependent upon payment services such as PayPal or Amazon.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>All of these institutions can arbitrarily choose to shutdown user accounts, without notice,
                    effectively halting all future financial transactions.
                    However, with cryptocurrency, so long as miners continue to validate transactions,
                    any one node can be terminated from the system,
                    without impacting the rest of the infrastructure.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>With Ethereum, power is entirely in the hands of individual users,
                    rather than faceless multi-national corporations (which horde their capital at the expense of the public), financial institutions or governments,
                    which would gladly seize private assets to bail out failing business or to serve their own agendas (see <a href="">Bail-Ins</a>, <a href="">Civil Forfeiture</a>, <a href="">Eminent Domain</a> or the Greek financial crisis).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Ethereum is truly the future of finance, set to disrupt many traditional institutions through decentralization and empowering those who participate in the network.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>However, while most financial institutions are shunning the adopting of cryptocurrencies under the false guise of &amp;fraud prevention&amp;,
                    they are oddly contributing to their own potential decline.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Rather than fearing cryptocurrencies,
                    financial institutions should be embracing blockchain technologies,
                    since the further financial success of their clients would also then lead to stronger customer loyalty and further profits,
                    with their clients having greater access to capital to then further invest in those institutions which supported them,
                    by investing their profits in more traditional and stable investment vehicles offered by these institutions.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note'>While blockchain technologies pride themselves on anonymity (in theory),
                    with all transactions being recorded publicly (in a decentralized ledger holding all accounts and transactions),
                    through rudimentary powers of deduction by a forensic analyst or with the application of AI (and enough processing power),
                    the public nature of the blockchain allows transaction histories of wallets to be monitored.
                    Spending patterns can then be deduced using those data points (which are stored indefinitely).
                    Using additional techniques including correlation attacks,
                    it is possible to reasonably associate an individual to a wallet address on the blockchain,
                    with many companies now specialising in just that, in order to help regulators, law enforcement and governments thawrt illegal activities,
                    such as scams, money laundering or violating international sanctions.
