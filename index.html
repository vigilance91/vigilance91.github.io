                    <p>As with all of physical existence, being over 99.99% empty space<sup><a href="">[citation required]</a></sup>,
                    being composed of star dust over 4.6 billion years old (forged in the heart of a dying star),
                    the culmination of what constitutes any person is roughly (by mass):
                        <ul>
                            <li>65% Oxygen</li>
                            <li>9.5% Hydrogen</li>
                            <li>19% Carbon</li>
                            <li>3% Nitrogen</li>
                            <li>1.5% Calcium</li>
                            <li>1% Phosphorous</li>
                            <li>along with a handful of trace elements</li>

                    <p>With a genome consisting of ~3.23 billion randomly arranged base pairs,
                    across 23 pairs of chromosomes (which makes up [0.0007%, 0.0009%] of total body mass<sup><a href="">[citation required]</a></sup>),
                    99.9% of the human genome (excluding mitocondrial DNA) is shared by everyone<sup><a href="">[citation required]</a></sup>,
                    of which 5-8% is also composed of <a href="">endogenous retroviruses</a>.

                    <p class='note'>ERVs are technically foreign gene sequences which have parasitised a host genome (and are generally considered inactive) as the result of being transcripted after exposure to specific viral agents within geographically isolated regions.

                    <p>Beginning with the fusion event forging human chromosome 2 (birthing modern Homo Sapiens),
                    this distinct divergence from our 24 chromosome pair hominid relatives allowed our ancestors to stand tall above their competition,
                    to gaze towards the stars and the future.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Since then on, from a genetic standpoint for all practical purposes,
                    every human has been statistically the same.

                    depending on your interpretation of the <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/lp-argue/">Lucas-Penrose hypothesis</a> regarding Gödel's incompleteness theorems),
                    it is effectively impossible for the mind to fully understand itself,
                    requiring a higher level meta-grammar beyond its own capacity.

                    <p>This provides the fields of neuroscience, psychology and philosophy with an interesting and existential conundrum,
                    rendering all attempts at comprehending cognition ultimately futile.

                    since the human mind is the by product of and governed by the fundamental laws of nature (from which all physical processes derive),
                    it is thus required that not only is consciousness an inherent, emergent property of nature,
                    but also that the mind is intrinsically aware of those processes,
                    thus in order for the mind to function or even exist,
                    it must <i>know</i>.

                    aside from pointing out the Sanskrit concept of dukkha (the insatiable decay of all things, yielding to the stress of impermanence) which makes the idea of affixing permanent,
                    absolute traits to a temporary form (which constantly undergoes change due to entropy) seems a little ridiculous.
                    </p>
                    <p>Also, since the metaphysical nature of transcendental consciousness is impossible to fully comprehend (let alone convey to others),
                    such questions seem either unnecessarily arbitrary at best or existentially insignificant at worse.

                    <p>My love for computer science comes from the fact that it's the only written medium which is experienced dynamically,
                    where one does not simply passively observe the written word in a static order, like books.
                    Instead, users are driven by countless interactions,
                    where each experience has the potential to be new and unique.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Experienced with both DirectX and OpenGL, I have a deep passion for graphics programming.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>While conventionally used for rendering geometry to a screen, producing various visual effects,
                    this field expands vastly beyond that single application.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>At its core, graphics programming is the off-loading of algorithms from the CPU (central processing unit) onto a computer's GPU (graphic processing unit).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>GPUs were designed to leverage the immense power of asynchronous processing, without the need for synchronization primitives,
                    such as locks, mutexes or semaphores.
                        <p class='note'>While superior in terms of raw processing power,
                        this architecture does pose several drawbacks, however.
                        The primary one being, graphics processors can <b>not</b> implement a call stack<sup><a href="">[citation required]</a></sup>,
                        preventing certain techniques such as <a href="">recursion</a>,
                        which relies on a functional programming technique where,
                        where a method calls itself until a terminating condition is met or,
                        the stack is blown, resulting in very <b>bad</b> things happening.
                        <br>
                        The second being, any data submitted as input to the graphics pipeline is immutable.
                        Any operations performed on constants or buffers is unable to persist the state change beyond the current execution,
                        thus can not be subsequently accessed by the CPU code via the resource handle afterwards.
                        Instead, unique buffers must be separately bound to the pipeline for independent input and output operations (whoever, HLSL 5 introduced read/write textures/buffers).
                        As a result, typically the mapping of resources from the graphics card's RAM into conventional RAM is <b>not</b> allowed for those resources currently bound to the pipeline while rendering.
                        </p>
                    Their thousands of dedicated cores and their optimized instruction sets targeting vector, matrix, color math as well as accelerated and asynchronous access of indexed buffers allows
                    GPU programs (colloquially called <b><i>shaders</i></b>) have the ability to process large quantities of data in parallel.
                    This allows for significantly faster processing compared to the serial nature of processing the same data on a CPU.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note'>When appropriately leveraged with Multi-tasking or Multi-processing on the CPU,
                    execution can be increased by utilizing techniques such as background loading of resources,
                    or processing of i/o operations separately from the primary rendering logic.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Two of the most common applications of graphics programming in industry are in the fields of <a href="">artificial intelligence</a> and <a href="">cryptocurrencies</a>,
                    where highly computational intensive operations such as <a href="">machine learning</a> and <a href="">mining transaction blocks</a>, respectfully,
                    can be more efficiently performed with significantly higher output capacity than would be possible on a conventional 2 or 4 core processor alone,
                    with modern GPUs produced with literally hundreds (if not thousands) of cores.

                    <h4>Early Years</h4>
                    
                    <p>Joining Air Cadets when I was old enough,
                    I didn't learn leadership, discipline, or self reliance,
                    those qualities I already possessed and were only strengthened,
                    providing the foundation for the driven, entrepreneurial attitude I have today.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>By the age of 15 I was working a consistent part-time job while still attending high school,
                    cadets and actively participating in extra curricular sports such a Basketball and Track and Field.
                    By then, having made the rank of sergeant, I was regularly teaching classes on survival, drill, the principles of flight and related topics,
                    while also being a member of the drill team and color/flag party.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Through cadets, at age 17, I was accepted to the Power Pilot Program at the Kitchener/Waterloo International Airport,
                    to receive my private pilots license, well before having my G1 driver's license.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Throughout high school, I went to OFSSA three times for discuss and shot put,
                    consistently placing in the top 6 across the province each year.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Before leaving my home town for college, I had already traveled to, most notably
                        <ul>

                    <h4>College</h4>
                    <p>Shortly after moving to attend a course for video game design and development,
                    my life changed dramatically.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Within the first few months there, I had developed a C++ poker hashing algorithm and evaluator as my first major coding project.
                    When finished, my project outperformed those of my peers, as well as that of my instructor,
                    which he would eagerly brag about to his colleagues, earning me recognition across campuses.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>The game implements 5 common poker games,
                    leveraging fundamental principles of number theory and static programming techniques to execute,
                    analyze and compare hands of cards at a nearly instant time complexity.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>This project is still my proudest accomplishment from that time,
                    however the project source is not planned to be available any time soon.
                        <p class='note'>One of the core components of the project,
                        the Integer Sequence Library,
                        is available on github <a href="https://github.com/vigilance91?tab=repositories">here</a> and has been ported to several languages,
                        including C++, Python, PHP and Javascript.
                        </p>
                    The executable and associated static libraries may be released in the future,
                    as development permits.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>After that, my most notable projects were developing prototypes for a 3D DirectX-10 role playing game which loaded levels and basic models and had a primitive combat system and UI,
                    and two C# XNA titles which included a minecraft-esque farming simulator (including day/night cycle and growing crops with life-cycles) with real time xml editing tools (for level development),
                    as well as a space-flight shooter featuring upgrade-able weapons of various types (including laser cannons, photon-torpedoes and proximity mines) for Xbox 360.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>I also attended the Great Canadian App-athon in 2011 and 2012,
                    which was a 72 hour coding contest involving all colleges and universities across Canada.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Nearing the end of my college career I was regularly working 16-18 hour days (sometimes even periods of 48 hours or more) to meet my school work load,
                    while also pursuing my own side projects,
                    including an interest in cryptography,
                    but more importantly I would teach myself Python in my own time in hopes of adapting a bulky and cumbersome C++ template meta-programming markup language serialization library into a more elegant solution in Python.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    After completing that, the goal then was to write a C++ application with the Python interpreter embedded within it,
                    to leverage the added flexibility and modularity of Python.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>The advent of a functioning markup language parser lead to the formalization of a written standard,
                    that I personally developed and maintain to address many (personal) issues presented with both xml and json formats.
                    </p>
                    
                    <!--p>I would then go on to include these components with my larger 3D Direct-X engine to facilitate serialization of dynamic game objects created through the level editor
                    and to allow for hierarchical management of the application's resources.
                    </p-->
                </div>
                
                <div class='flex-row border border-dark rounded'>
                    <h4>Post College</h4>
                    <p>After graduation, I started an unpaid internship as an iOS/Objective-C mobile developer for a local independent studio.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>During the internship I also supported myself through working full time at a temp agency.
                    This required working 16 hours a day at 2 separate jobs for four months straight until I was hired to continue working as an iOS developer.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>As it was a small start-up, I was the sole developer working on their projects (with the owner/CEO being the artist),
                    I played all roles from lead developer (including writing shell script build tools and photoshop scripts),
                    to QA tester and Research and Development.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    I was also responsible for all aspects of the life cycle of multiple built target applications which implemented a diverse tool chain.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Within my first year, roughly 10 applications had either been released or updated,
                        to which the most successful app having over 3.5 million downloads and continues to be highly successful to this day.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Unfortunately, near the end of my employment with Sky Orchard Studios, I would suffer a devastating personal loss,
                    with all of my personal hardware being stolen from my apartment.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    This effectively resulted in the loss of all my projects, notes, source code, examples and backups of my entire life's work up to that point,
                    causing a devastating professional set back, which, to this day, still has not been fully recovered from.
                    </p>

                    <p>Going back to the temp agency, after the contract expired, I would take on various manual labour roles to survive.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>After several months of factory work,
                    I would finally get the opportunity to recover from the theft of my life's work,
                    finally being able to purchase a laptop for a job as a web developer.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>At that point I quickly taught myself javascript, html, css, php, and mySQL while on the job.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>While there, I worked closely with 1 other dedicated developer and a small group of 2-5 interns updating an Actionscript based web application to HTML5.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>As a senior team member, I primarily supervised the interns assisting in their tasks,
                    while simultaneously working on my own.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Unfortunately, the company would dissolve before the product could launch.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Afterward, at the age of 25, I would go on to secure employment at my former college,
                    teaching the very course I had once taken not so long ago.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Shortly after beginning my new job, I became a father of an amazing son.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>During that time, I worked 10-16 hours a day, teaching 2 separate classes and was responsible for managing groups between 4-12 students at a time.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Lectures included the foundational concepts of computer programming, software development, video game design and the software production life-cycle,
                    with the course's primary focus being on Unity/C#, Xcode/Swift, Win32/DirectX-11, and mobile/web development using HTML and Javascript.
                    </p>

                    <p>In my free time, I began further expanded my knowledge of graphics programming by developing exciting,
                    easy to use, interactive examples and tools to help with visualization of abstract rendering concepts,
                    while also working towards building a minimalist graphics engine for the web on my own.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>After a year, I decided to leave to be a stay-at-home father, to raise and teach my, by then, 1 year old son,
                    while my form spouse went back to both college and work after taking time off while we waited for our son to be accepted into a childcare program.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>I would eventually go on to work as a PHP and RPA solution developer for various business clients, including <a href="">GreenEarth</a>.

                    <h4>Recently</h4>
                    <p>As of today, I am fluent in over (a combined) 10 programming, scripting, shading or markup languages.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>In my sparse spare time,
                    I have taken an interest in dabbling in computer forensics (utilizing the vast FOSS tools provided on various Linux platforms) as well as,
                    beginning to learn TensorFlow for machine learning,
                    React for web UI development and NodeJS for back-end server development.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>My main focus as of today is the Ethereum blockchain, developing Solidity smart-contracts.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>With the many personal projects currently under development across multiple platforms (see <a hef="">projects<a>),
                    it has become quite time consuming for developing and maintaining them all (even with appropriate software tools for minimizing workflow overhead) as a single developer,
                    thus I have opened up several open-source repositories for some of the more mature projects,
                    in hopes of attracting additional interest,
                    allowing myself to focus on younger, more ambitious, projects.

                    the 1917 revision of the <a herf="">Political Constitution of the United Mexican States</a> is (so far) the only founding political document of a North American country that enshrines,
                    the right of every citizen to both housing and a hospitable ecosystem, supportive of their development and welfare,
                    under Article 4<sup><a href="">citation required</a></sup>,
                    while also stating under Article 27<sup><a href="">citation required</a></sup>:
                        all land, water and natural resources within their borders is owned by the Nation (thus belonging to all of its people),
                        with any wealth generated from the exploitation of these resources to be equally distributed amongst all citizens.
                    The Mexican Constitution also reserves the right of responsibility for all ecological and conservation concerns (also under Article 27).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="note">Considering the Mexican Constitution was written well over a century ago,
                    it should be both a source of personal and national shame that the same or similar ideals still have not been amended to either the <a href="">Constitution of the United States of American</a> nor,
                    the <a href="">Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a>.
                    Seeing as the Mexican Congress of 1917 was objectively more progressive than their modern counterparts in Canada and the U.S. in establishing socio-environmental rights for citizens,
                    which have now been enjoyed by Mexican citizens for several generations, it is astonishing such legal frameworks do not exist outside Mexico.

                    <h3 class='text-center'>Integer Sequences Libraries</h3>
                    <p>In number theory, there are many common sequences which are highly prevalent in nature,
                    such as the Primes or Fibonacci Numbers,
                    with many having intimate ties to more complex fields of science and math, such as cryptography.
                    Yet, many common languages lack built-in support for generating such sequences.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>This project seeks to remedy this by offering a standardized API, which is shared across multiple platforms.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>The Integer Sequence Library projects are based off the <a href="http://oeis.org/">Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>.
                    Unlike some APIs which simply grab the binary file from the OEIS, then serialize them directly into objects,
                    this library, rather than depending on an Internet connection and then parsing a text/binary file,
                    allows for native platform support for generating common integer sequences,
                    allowing for much more power and speed as it does away with
                        <ul>
                            <li>*dependency upon an established Internet connection(if no connection or website is down, no functionality).</li>
                            <li>*does not need to wait for server responses(sending, receiving and processing http requests takes time).</li>
                            <li>*does not need to parse server response into native data (data is already generated natively).</li>
                            <li>*does not need to make multiple requests to the server to generate multiple or varying iterations of a sequences,
                            as typically a static series can be generated just once on start-up and used indefinitely while the application runs.
                            </li>
                            <li>*developers do not need to worry about buffer overflows (receiving too much data from server, blowing the stack) or,
                            receiving data which does not support native data-type sizes (either to large or too small of values or the wrong data type entirely).</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>All of these are major drawbacks and are associated with major overhead,
                        none of which are present when generating native sequences using these libraries.
                        Many sequence interfaces included in these libraries provide iterative and recursive alternatives (plus generators in languages that support them).
                        </p>

                    <p>Dating back to the first documented mechanized counting device,
                    created by the French child prodigy <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Blaise-Pascal">Blaise Pascal</a>
                    (excluding the discovery of the ancient Greek <a href="">Antikythera mechanism</a>, used calculate the dates of astrolgoical phenomena),
                    all computers have been designed to make human processes easier (such as computing mathematical equations).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Robotic process automation can then be described as the mechanical emulation of collections of tasks, with little or no intervention.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Expanding on the definition of computing (simply as the execution of instruction sets),
                    RPA technology provides the ability for machines to reproduce complex (often time consuming) interactions with programs (typically through scripted GUI actions),
                    in a manner which is more convenient for individuals and more cost effective for businesses.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>With RPA technology, mundane, repetitive tasks (such as downloading pdf invoices from an email account sent by a specific client, then archiving the files) can be significantly hastened,
                    thus reducing associated overhead.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Since automated processes are significantly faster than a human performing the same task,
                    it is only natural that developers designing, reusable automated workflows are more valuable assets to a business,
                    than the alternative of continually paying employee wages and benefits for work which can be performed by computers.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Just like the advent of the industrial revolution saw slow, hazardous and expensive human labour replaced by (relatively) cheap steam powered machines,
                    the technological revolution of the 21st century will see more and more
                    </p>

                    occupying all possibilities, simultaneously.

                    Where all that is need to execute quantum programs is a Quantum Processing Unit (much like a conventional CPU),
                    a full quantum computer has all of it corresponding conventional counterpart replaced with quantum analogues,
                    such as quantum RAM or storage.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Mathematical Representation</h4>
                    <p>Most commonly, quantum gates take the form of <a href="">Pauli Matrices</a>.
                    Similar to matrix algebra, quantum operations are performed, typically, through the composition of two or more of the 3 Pauli matrices.
                    Other common gates include phase shift and gates.
                        <p class='note'>The identity matrix(also expressed as the Kronecker delta) is considered the zeroth Pauli matrix.</p>
                    What is truly interesting about the math behind quantum computing (as a branch of complex mathematics) is that,
                    while its principles have been laid out and well understood since by mathematicians for centuries,
                    it was widely held that complex mathematics (while weird and interesting), held no practical application in the real world,
                    until the relatively recent advances in science in the early 20th century regarding fields such as electromagnetism, sub-atomic particle physics and the foundation of quantum mechanics itself.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Not only does complex algebra accurately and conveniently describe the nature of light and other natural phenomena,
                    Pauli matrices (and their various combinations) also give the most concise mathematical expression of quarks (the building blocks of protons, neutrons and their antimatter counter parts),
                    as represented by the the most modern understanding of string theory.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Conceptualization</h4>
                    <p>At its most rudimentary conception, gates can be conceived of in a similar manner to polarized lenses,
                    which cause light to be filtered (or rather, collapse its wave function),
                    dependent upon the photon's electromagnetic charge (expressed as a complex number) and the lens' polarization.
                    Depending upon the light entering, photons will either pass the lens (representing a logical value of true/1) if parallel to the polarization or,
                    will not pass through (representing a logical value of false/0) if it is orthogonal to the polarization.
                    When the charge of a photon is at an angle not parallel or orthogonal to the polarization,
                    since quantum states can only be expressed with whole number coefficients,
                    interacting with the lens causes the photon to "decide", based on its wave function,
                    to collapse and become 1 or 0, passing or being absorbed by the filter respectively.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Observing qubits and performing operations in quantum programs follows the same principle.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><h4>Example</h4>
                    One of the most fundamental cases for a single qubit program is for representing flipping a coin,
                    where each outcome has a 50-50 chance of occurring.
                        <p class='note'>This is an ideal system, where all external factors (such as wind resistance, ambient temperature and pressure, etc) and,
                        any unlikely outcomes such as the coin landing on its side or any number of other indeterminate states are not taken into consideration.
                        </p>
                    By applying a (..) gate, when the qubit is measured, it will have a 50% probability of being either 1 or 0,
                    with the results almost always creating an even distribution of alternating 0's and 1's.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note'>This effect is significantly different on a conventional computer,
                    where true randomness is incredibly difficult to emulate.
                    Instead, generating pseudo-random numbers can produce close results however,
                    there will always be an underlying pattern (based on the algorithm used),
                    thus creating an even distribution of probabilist outcomes is almost impossible without various inherent biases or emergent patterns.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Blockchain &amp; Cryptocurrency</h3>
                    
                    <p>Cryptocurrency, often (and inappropriately) shortened to simply <i>crypto</i> in media (which is absurd because <i>crypto</i> is already a prefix derived from the Greek word kryptos, meaning hidden or secret),
                    is a newly evolving technology which leverages a public, distributed ledger, called the blockchain,
                    to immutably record transactions between address on the network, which is validated by peers in a decrentralized fashion.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note'>Cryptocurrency should not simply be referred to as <i>crypto</i> (despite the allure),
                    for the same reason that neither Geometry, Geology nor Geography should ever be referred to as <i>geo</i>, due to ambiguity.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>At its core, cryptocurrency technology is based on several concepts.
                        <!--TODO: convert to table-->
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <a href="">Ledger</a>, a permanent, decentralized, publicly available log of all actions carried out on the network, also referred to as the <i>blockchain</i>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="">Assets</a>, a unit of value or vector of work on the network
                            </li>
                            <li>

                            <li>
                                <a href="">Transactions</a>, records of the exchange of assets on the network, referred to as <i>blocks</i>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="">Miner</a>, any computer which processes and validates transactions on the network, also referred to as a <i>node</i>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <a href="">Smart Contract</a>, a trustless application for facilitating the exchange of value on the blockchain
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>These fundamental aspects make cryptocurrency and blockchain technology incredibly powerful.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Cryptocurrency networks are supported by miners which verify transactions using a consensus mechanism.
                    This mechanism ensures all nodes agree that a transaction happened and is valid,
                    which prevents dishonesty by one node fraudulently attempting to modify the blockchain.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Machines which contribute to processing transactions are typically rewarded for their effort by receiving a small payout in the form of network assets.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>With the blockchain distributed across all machines participating on the network,
                    targeting a single node for exploitation, effectively renders common malicious techniques,
                    such as DDoS attacks, ineffective at worst and obsolete at best,
                    since disruption of any one network participant has little to no effect on the capacity of the network to operate as a whole,
                    combined with the distributed nature of the blockchain, any malicious actions on a single node will have no effect on the network as a whole,
                    with any blocks which are deemed to be invalid under the consensus mechanism discarded and ignored.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note'>There are, however, other forms of attacks on decentralized networks,
                    such as the infamous 51% attack,
                    where if a single actor controls at least 51% of the nodes on any network,
                    they effectively control the consensus mechanism of that network,
                    by deciding which transaction are valid and which are not.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>There are currently hundreds of unique cryptocurrency platforms,
                    with some of the most popular including:
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="">Bitcoin</a></li>
                            <li><a href="">Ethereum</a></li>
                            <li><a href="">EOS</a></li>
                            <li><a href="">Litecoin</a></li>
                            <li><a href="">Tether</a></li>
                            <li><a href="">IOTA</a></li>
                            <li><a href="">Dash</a></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Additionally, there are &amp;<i>stable coins</i>&amp;,
                    which are backed by reserves of fiat currencies and are less volatile than conventional cryptocurrencies,
                    as well as the more recent development of cryptocurrency backed ETFs, stocks in blockchain technology companies and other similar products which financial institutions may offer.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>While each platform offers unique advantages and disadvantages,
                    the Ethereum network has proven to be the strongest competition by market cap,
                    second only to the infamous, Bitcoin.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Ethereum is a decentralized cryptocurrency platform in its infancy,
                    developed by Russian born Canadian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitalik_Buterin">Vitalik Buterin</a>.
                    The Ethereum network is often referred to as the next generation of the internet,
                    at least as far as electronic currency and E-commerce is concerned.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note'>While Ethereum technically falls under the umbrella term of cryptocurrency,
                    this may be a slight misnomer as it is clearly stated on the foundation's <a href="">website</a> that it is explicitly <b>NOT</b> intended as a form of currency,
                    but rather as a medium of power to facilitate transactions on the network and reward miners for their contribution of processing blocks,
                    much like gasoline is used to power a car to facilitate the movement of people and goods.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note'>This if further supported by the Canadian government's determination that Ethereum is <b>not</b> a <b>currency</b> nor a <b>security</b>,
                    but rather a vehicle by which barter transactions are carried out between individuals.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>For example, while conventional currency (an intermediary vector of abstract value backed only by society's precieved need to facilitate trade)
                    may be used to purchase gasoline (a physical vector of potential work energy) to operate a car,
                    one can not simply inject currency into an internal-combustion engine to have it operate (although paper money does burn) likewise,
                    petrol is not legal tender, thus can not be used legitimately as a direct medium for exchanging goods and services,
                    without first exchanging it for fiat currency by selling it on the open market.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>While most people new to the world of cryptocurrency typically get quickly overwhelmed with the many unfamiliar or foreign concepts,
                    it is much less intimidating once coming to the realization that, in many ways,
                    the concept of expressing value with digital assets is actually already employed ubiquitously in the everyday life of the modern world.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Do you take advantage of Credit cards with reward points or,
                    any other customer loyalty systems which awards users unique currencies which can't be redeemed for legal tender?
                    How about laundry machines that accept reloadable chip-cards or, wristbands/access passes at amusement parks?
                    Then you are already using cryptocurrencies and didn't know it!
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Just like rewards points from credit-cards and corporate loyalty programs,
                    Ethereum and related technologies are not currencies, yet can still be used to acquire goods and services,
                    much like using rewards points may allow for the purchase of goods or services,
                    without the direct use of currency.</p>
                    
                    <p>The only difference with Ethereum is the decentralized nature of the system,
                    existing entirely ephemerally within the distributed blockchain,
                    as opposed to a centralized server, owned by a single entity.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Where corporate conglomerates or banking syndicates maintain sole control of the traditional systems their users/consumers access,
                    with Ethereum anyone and everyone can effectively create their own
                        <ul>
                            <li>financial system</li>

                            <li>charity or non-profit organization</li>
                            <li>crowd funding campaign</li>
                            <li>casino or lottery</li>
                            <li>contracts representing property ownership (referred to as non-fungible tokens), including royalties or company stocks (these tokens may be subject to securities regulations)</li>
                            <li>entirely secure and transparent democratic organizations</li>
                        </ul>
                    all without ever having to rely on third party banking institutions, credit card companies or having to be dependent upon payment services such as PayPal or Amazon.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>All of these institutions can arbitrarily choose to shutdown user accounts, without notice,
                    effectively halting all future financial transactions.
                    However, with cryptocurrency, so long as miners continue to validate transactions,
                    any one node can be terminated from the system,
                    without impacting the rest of the infrastructure.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>With Ethereum, power is entirely in the hands of individual users,
                    rather than faceless multi-national corporations (which horde their capital at the expense of the public), financial institutions or governments,
                    which would gladly seize private assets to bail out failing business or to serve their own agendas (see <a href="">Bail-Ins</a>, <a href="">Civil Forfeiture</a>, <a href="">Eminent Domain</a> or the Greek financial crisis).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Ethereum is truly the future of finance, set to disrupt many traditional institutions through decentralization and empowering those who participate in the network.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>However, while most financial institutions are shunning the adopting of cryptocurrencies under the false guise of &amp;fraud prevention&amp;,
                    they are oddly contributing to their own potential decline.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Rather than fearing cryptocurrencies,
                    financial institutions should be embracing blockchain technologies,
                    since the further financial success of their clients would also then lead to stronger customer loyalty and further profits,
                    with their clients having greater access to capital to then further invest in those institutions which supported them,

                    <p class='note'>While blockchain technologies pride themselves on anonymity (in theory),
                    with all transactions being recorded publicly (in a decentralized ledger holding all accounts and transactions),
                    through rudimentary powers of deduction by a forensic analyst or with the application of AI (and enough processing power),
                    the public nature of the blockchain allows transaction histories of wallets to be monitored.
                    Spending patterns can then be deduced using those data points (which are stored indefinitely).
                    Using additional techniques including correlation attacks,
                    it is possible to reasonably associate an individual to a wallet address on the blockchain,
                    with many companies now specialising in just that, in order to help regulators, law enforcement and governments thawrt illegal activities,
                    such as scams, money laundering or violating international sanctions.
