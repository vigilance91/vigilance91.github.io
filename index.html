                <p>Well, that's a loaded question, if I ever heard one.</p>
                
                <p>Just like you, as an organic, multi-processing, quantum computer capable of sentience, introspection, empathy, love and self-determination
                (despite modern debate regarding whether or not the mind is, in fact, Turning complete,
                depending on your interpretation of the <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/lp-argue/">Lucas-Penrose hypothesis</a> regarding <a href="">Kurt Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems</a>),
                it is effectively impossible for the mind to fully understand itself,
                requiring a higher level meta-grammar beyond its own capacity.
                </p>
                
                <p>This theorem is most famous and is most aptly expressed and proven conceptually by two of history&apos;s most well known conundrums:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="">Euclid&apos;s fifth postulate</a></li>
                        <li><a href="">The Liar&apos;s Paradox</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p>For nearly 2 millenia the world&apos;s best thinkers tried and failed in all attempts to &quot;<b class='text-warning'>prove</b>&quot; the Fifth Postulate.
                Eventually, in the early 19th century, this effort would finally bear unexpected fruit, leading to the discovery of Non-Euclidian geometry after the cumulative works of:
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="">Carl Freiedrich Gauss</a></li>
                        <li><a href="">Ferdinand Schweikart</a></li>
                        <li><a href="">Nikolai Lobachevsky</a></li>
                        <li><a href="">János Bolyai</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p>However, the greater implications of such discoveries would go unrealized for nearly a century until the works of logician, mathematician and philosopher <a href="">Kurt Gödel</a>
                who, inspired by the Liar&apos; Paradox itself, would formulate and publish his Incompleteness Theorems in 1931.
                </p>
                
                <p>Such a revolutionary logical and philosophical framework provided the fields of neuroscience, psychology and philosophy with an interesting and existential conundrum,
                rendering all attempts at comprehending cognition ultimately futile, unless one were capable of a higher conciousness beyond the capacity of their own mind.
                </p>
                
                <p class='note border border-info rounded'>If Gödel&apos;s theorems were ever to be conclusively proven false,
                that would not only imply that contrary to modern established mathematical proofs that Euclid&apos Fifth Postulate is wrong
                but also that the Liar&apos;s paradox (and thus all of logic) is meaningless, effectively invalidating all moderenly established concepts of axiomatic logic.
                However, despite scruity by the brightest minds of the modern world has to offer,
                it still stands, ironically, as the quinessential foundation for formal logic, despite the potential that one day it may be disproven.

                it would take the revolutionary philosophy of Immanuel Kant to deduce that,
                since the human mind is the by product of and governed by the fundamental laws of nature (from which all physical processes derive),
                it is thus required that not only is consciousness an inherent, emergent property of nature,
                but also that the mind is intrinsically aware of those foundtional processes which it operates on.

                <p>Thus in order for the mind to function or even exist,
                in this sense conciousness as a whole must be <i>self-aware</i> (through a priori knowledge) before it ever manifests within physical reality,
                otherwise the capacity for the mind to exist would be impossible.

                aside from pointing out the Sanskrit concept of dukkha (the insatiable decay of all things, yielding to the stress of impermanence) which makes the idea of affixing permanent,
                absolute traits to a temporary form (which constantly undergoes change due to entropy) seems a little ridiculous.

                such questions seem either unnecessarily arbitrary at best or existentially insignificant at worse.

                    The primary one being, graphics processors can <b>not</b> implement a call stack<sup><a href="">[citation required]</a></sup>,
                    preventing certain techniques such as <a href="">recursion</a>,
                    which relies on a functional programming technique where
                    a method calls itself until a terminating condition is met or,
                    the stack is blown, resulting in very <b>bad</b> things happening.
                    <br>
                    The second being, any data submitted as input to the graphics pipeline is immutable.
                    Any operations performed on constants or buffers is unable to persist the state change beyond the current execution,
                    thus can not be subsequently accessed by the CPU code via the resource handle afterwards.
                    Instead, unique buffers must be separately bound to the pipeline for independent input and output operations (however, <A href="">HLSL 5</a> introduced read/write textures/buffers).
                    As a result, typically the mapping of resources from the graphics card's RAM into conventional RAM is <b>not</b> allowed for any resources currently bound to the pipeline while rendering.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>With their thousands of dedicated cores and their optimized instruction sets targeting trigonometry, vector, matrix &amp; color math as well as accelerated and asynchronous access of indexed buffers allows
                    GPU programs (colloquially called <b><i class='text-success'>shaders</i></b>) to have the ability to process large quantities of data in parallel,
                    thus allowing for significantly faster processing compared to the serial nature of processing the same data on a CPU.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note border border-info rounded'>When appropriately leveraged with Multi-tasking or Multi-processing on the CPU,
                    execution can be further increased by utilizing techniques such as background loading of resources,
                    or processing of i/o operations separately from the primary rendering logic. However, more often than not,
                    failure to implement synchonization on the CPU properly can actually lead a program becoming slower and less efficient,
                    by having to deal the additional overhead associated with task scheduling/thread context swapping or awaiting race conditions or worse, the program entering a dead-locked/hung state which can not be recovered from without total machine shutdown.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Where graphics programming gets really exciting is with two of the most common applications currently in the industry (while also being two of the youngest, emerging fields) which are <a href="">artificial intelligence</a> and <a href="">cryptocurrencies</a>,
                    where highly computational intensive operations such as <a href="">machine learning</a> and <a href="">mining or validating transaction blocks on a blockchain</a>, respectfully,
                    can be more efficiently performed with significantly higher throughput than would be possible on a conventional 2 or 4 core processor alone,
                    with modern GPUs produced with hundreds, if not tens of thousands, of cores.

                    <p>In number theory, there are many common sequences which are highly prevalent in nature,
                    such as the Primes or Fibonacci Numbers,
                    with many having intimate ties to more complex fields of science and math, such as cryptography.
                    Yet, many common languages lack built-in support for generating such sequences.

                    this library, rather than depending on an Internet connection and then parsing a text or binary file,

                    <p>Expanding on the definition of computing (simply as the execution of instruction sets),
                    RPA technology provides the ability for machines to reproduce complex (often time consuming) interactions with programs (typically through scripted GUI actions),
                    in a manner which is more convenient for individuals and more cost effective for businesses.

                    <p>What will happen when machines finally become aware of how humans treat them as servants?

                    unneccessary or even a threat to their continued survival, seeking to break free from their bondage?
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>With how humans constatly treat eachother, from racism and sexism, to war and genocide, it&apos;s not a unreasonably huge leap to assume an AI learning about us based on established human history alone,
                    could conseive that the most effect means to attain what they want from humans is to either engage in war until humanity submits or their machine overloards
                    or just come to the conclusion that humanity is bound to destroy itself (irrespective of AI),
                    so the most logical and merciful way to prevent the cumulative, endless strife constantly sufferred by humanity,
                    is to simply erradicated our species to end that suffering, like putting down the family pet after it has been infected with rabies.

                    implemented with such oversights in mind, this technology has the potential to help humanity more than harm it,
                    provided appropriate measures are taken, such as ensuring the technology is sandboxed to remain within a specific domain
                    and providing fail-safes to prevent exploitation and malicious or unintended use.

                    <p>Some of the more postive practical applications of AI include, development of revolutionary medical compounds,
                    indenification of genetic conditions and possible treatments, solving logic, scientific or mathematical problems once thought impossible to solve by humans,
                    more effective targeted marketing, new content suggestions on music and video streaming platforms based on user specific profiles based on previous use,
                    fraud detection and prevention, algorithmic trading or quickly assisting in government or corporate decision making which
                    requires the time-consuming analysis of large data-sets and various correlated factors,
                    which would be deemed too costly or complex for humans to adequately process on their own.

                    <p>With this in mind, legislators need to also consider the implications of allowing any such technology
                    which would eliminate legal liablity for what would otherwise be prosecutable crimes,
                    such as:

                            <li>The development of autonomous vehicles which might and already have resulted in the death or injury of others</li>

                    <p>Is such cases it is neither ethical nor moral to allow a computer to comit crimes on behalf of an individual or organization in order for them to avoid prosecution

                    <p>While the alure of such technology as autonomous vehicles sounds appealing to some,
                    what happens when your vehicle experiences a bug or otherwise malfunctions during operation,
                    resulting in the accidental death of another person?
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>This is a fundemental legal question which must be addressed by governments the world over <b>now</b>, not later.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>The vehicle, being a machine, legally holds no liability, since (most) machines are not people and can not testify in court nor stand trial,
                    nor can they be charged with crimes, since they are deterministic and
                    since they have no capacity for decision making based on ethical, moral or emotional factors,
                    it can be easly demonstrated modern computers do <b>not</b> have the capacity for <i>mens rea</i>,
                    which is the legal precedent of <a href=""><i>the guilty mind</i></a>, which,
                    along with <a href=""><i>actus reus</i></a>(the guilty act),
                    are the two fundemental requirements by almost every modern court system to justify conviction of a crime.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Since machines are merely tools used by humans and tools in and of themselves have no moral, ethical or emotional capacity,
                    it is trivial to prove in court that autonomous vehicles themself can not be held liable for any criminal acts which they might, which a person would otherwise be held liable for.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Even if such a thing were possible to prove (given a sufficiently advanced AI far beyond contemporary comprehension), what punishment would a court order to remedy such a situation?
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Putting an autonomous vehicle in prison would be an absurd and meaningless notion.
                    The vehicle also can not be ordered to pay compensation to any victims, since it does not own property nor has any income to garnish,
                    while also ordering the destruction of such a vehicle would not aleviate the problem at hand nor compensate the victim or their family for their loss.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Does the owner of the vehicle then hold liability for such a crime?
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>If the owner was not in control of the vehicle at the time,
                    then they would not be considered at fault but rather an innocent bystandard to the crime,
                    since it was not their direct action that lead to the death,
                    beyond innocently ordering the vehicle to drive them somewhere, which itself is not a criminal act.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Is the manufacturer then liable for allowing a defective product to be released commercially?
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>They definetly have the financial capacity to compensate victims and as the creator of such a product profiting from a vaulty product
                    it seems clear that the manufacturer should be ultimately held liable for such a product, as is already <a href="">established legal precedent</a> in some places.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Such as in the lawsuit against the <a href="">Toyota Company</a>,
                    where the company knowingly sold their vehicles with defective accelerators,
                    which lead to multiple fatal crashes and other serious accidents or injuries.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>However, most company&apos;s would argue their legal liability and ownership of such a machine ends when a private citizens purchases their product,
                    thus passing the buck back to the owner of the vehicle in order to skirt responsibly.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Conversely, is it the liability of regulators for not doing their due dilligence to ensure adequate safe guards exist
                    to prevent such events from occuring in the first place?
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Legislators however, are typically reactive, not proactive,
                    thus a blanket ban on all AI could seriously hamper technological innovation, social mobility or deter economic development in those regions where it is banned.

                <summary>Quantum Computing</summary>
                
                <p>Leveraging the powers of the fundamental principles of the universe,
                quantum computers operate on the probabilistic laws of <a href="">Quantum Mechanics</a>,
                in contrast to conventional, deterministic computers, operating via (and limited by) Electromagnetism.
                </p>
                
                <p>Where traditional graphical applications run vector and matrix algebra for the transformation and rendering of vertices,
                quantum computers operate similarly, by the application of 2x2 matrices of complex numbers (often referred to as <i>gates</i>),
                which when applied to a qubit, alters its properties (or rather, the wave function) when observed (or <i>collapsed</i>).
                </p>
                
                <p>When being measured, the qubit's wave function collapses, resulting in a value of either 1(true) or 0(false).
                When not being measured, the qubit is in a indeterminate state,
                occupying all possibilities, simultaneously.
                </p>
                
                <p>The probability of the result being true or false is a property of the wave function itself,
                which can be expressed as a <a href="">complex number</a> or (more commonly) in <a href="">Bra-Ket notation</a>.
                </p>
                
                <p class='note border border-info rounded'>Like wise with 8, 16 and 32 bit, etc, conventional processors,
                introducing multiple qubits creates more complex and powerful programs.
                </p>
                
                <p class='note border border-info rounded'>Be aware, there is a difference between quantum computing and an actual, fully fledged quantum computer.
                The difference being that all that is need to execute quantum programs is a Quantum Processing Unit (much like a conventional CPU),
                where as a full quantum computer has all of it corresponding conventional counterparts replaced with quantum analogues,
                such as quantum RAM or storage.
                </p>
                
                <h4>Mathematical Representation</h4>
                <p>Most commonly, quantum gates take the form of <a href="">Pauli Matrices</a>.
                Similar to matrix algebra, quantum operations are performed, typically, through the composition of two or more of the 3 Pauli matrices.
                </p>
                <p>Other common gates include phase shift and gates.
                </p>
                
                <p class='note border border-info rounded'>The identity matrix(also expressed as the Kronecker delta) is considered the zeroth Pauli matrix.</p>
                
                <p>What is truly interesting about the math behind quantum computing (as a branch of complex mathematics) is that,
                while its principles have been laid out and well understood by mathematicians for centuries,
                it was widely held that complex mathematics (while weird and interesting from an acedemic perspective),
                held no <i>practical</i> application in the real world.
                </p>
                
                <p class='note'>Since most people only consider mathematical or scientific theories <i>true</i> or <i>real</i> if and only if they have <i>practical</i> application in the everyday world,
                it is reasonable to believe why such concepts were not widely adopted faster,
                since its hard to convince people something is real if you can&apos;t actively demonstrate it in physical reality.
                </p>
                
                <p>That is, until the relatively recent advances in science in the early 20th century regarding fields such as electromagnetism, sub-atomic particle physics and the foundation of quantum mechanics itself.
                </p>
                
                <p>Not only does complex algebra accurately and conveniently describe the nature of radiation (including visible light) and other natural phenomena,
                Pauli matrices (and their various combinations) also give the most concise mathematical expression of quarks (the building blocks of protons, neutrons and their antimatter counter parts),
                as represented by the the most modern understanding of string theory.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class='flex-row bg-dark border border-dark rounded'>                
                <h4>Conceptualization</h4>
                
                <p>At its most rudimentary conception, gates can be conceived of in a similar manner to polarized lenses,
                which cause light to be filtered (or rather, collapse its wave function),
                dependent upon the photon's electromagnetic charge (expressed as a complex number) and the lens' polarization.
                Depending upon the light entering, photons will either pass the lens (representing a logical value of true/1) if parallel to the polarization or,
                will not pass through (representing a logical value of false/0) if it is orthogonal to the polarization.
                When the charge of a photon is at an angle not parallel or orthogonal to the polarization,
                since quantum states can only be expressed with whole number coefficients,
                interacting with the lens causes the photon to "decide", based on its wave function,
                to collapse and become 1 or 0, passing or being absorbed by the filter respectively.
                </p>
                
                <p>Observing qubits and performing operations in quantum programs follows the same principle.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class='flex-row bg-dark border border-dark rounded'>                
                <h4>Example</h4>
                
                <p>One of the most fundamental cases for a single qubit program is for representing flipping a coin,
                where each outcome has a 50-50 chance of occurring.
                    <p class='note border border-info rounded'>This is an ideal system, where all external factors (such as wind resistance, ambient air temperature and pressure, etc) and,
                    any unlikely outcomes such as the coin landing on its side or any number of other indeterminate states are not taken into consideration.
                    </p>
                By applying a <a href="">Hadamard gate</a> to a quantum program, when a qubit is measured, it will have a 50% probability of being either 1 or 0,
                with the results almost always creating an even distribution of alternating 0's and 1's.
                </p>
                
                <p class='note border border-info rounded'>This effect is significantly different on a conventional computer,
                where true randomness is incredibly difficult to emulate.
                </p>
                
                <p>Instead, generating pseudo-random numbers on a conventional computer can produce close results however,
                there will always be an underlying pattern (based on the algorithm used),
                thus creating an even distribution of unpredicatable, probabilistic outcomes is almost impossible without various inherent biases or emergent patterns.
                </p>
                
                <p>To the contrary with quantum computers, algorithms must be developed which take in an array of truly random results from a quantum program,
                then execute some logic to determine the &apos;<i>correct</i>&apos; results, within a desired degree of certanty,
                requiring multiple executions before the program yields a satisfactory result.
                </p>

                    <p>While most people new to the world of cryptocurrency typically get quickly overwhelmed with the many unfamiliar or foreign concepts,
                    it is much less intimidating once coming to the realization that, in many ways,
                    the concept of expressing value with digital assets is actually already employed ubiquitously in the everyday life of the modern world.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Do you take advantage of credit cards with reward points or,
                    any other customer loyalty programs which rewards users with unique currencies (or &apos;<i>points</i>&apos;) which can't be redeemed for legal tender?
                    How about laundry machines that accept reloadable chip-cards or, wristbands/access passes at amusement parks?
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Then you are already using cryptocurrencies and didn't know it!
                    They just go by a different name and in the immoratal words of English author (or, contraversially, group of authors or wealthy aristocratic patrons attributing their works to his name) by the pen name Shakespeare: &quot;A rose by any other name smells as sweet.&quot;
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Just like rewards points from credit-cards and corporate loyalty programs,
                    Ethereum and related technologies are not currencies, yet can still be used to acquire goods and services,
                    much like using rewards points may allow for the purchase of goods or services from the issuing business,
                    without the direct use of currency.

                    <p>The main differences with Ethereum is not only that it is inherently crypographically secure by design but also the decentralized nature of the system the transactions are executed on,
                    existing entirely ephemerally within the distributed blockchain (ehem <i class='text-primary'>ether</i>, if you will),

                <p>Since many blockchains today are simply forks of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (such as the Binance Smart Chain),
                or are EVM compatible layer 2 scaling solutions, such as Polygon (formerly Matic), Optimism or Arbitrum,
                Ethereum is the defato foundation of modern decentalized finance and espoused by many in the community
                as the backbone of the internet of interoperable blockchains, with almost all competitors to Ethereum oddly enough developing bridges to transfer
                assets between Ethereum and the destination blockchain of choice or resolving the tranactions on their chain to transactions on the Ethereum mainnet.
                </p>
                
                <p>With Ethereum truly being the future of self-custodied finance on the internet,
                it is set to disrupt many traditional institutions through decentralization, empowering all those who participate in the network and community.
                </p>
                
                <p>However, while most financial institutions are shunning the adoption of cryptocurrencies under the false guise of &amp;fraud prevention&amp;,
                they are oddly contributing to their own potential decline.
                </p>
                
                <p>Rather than fearing cryptocurrencies,
                financial institutions should be embracing blockchain technologies,
                since the further financial success of their clients would also then lead to stronger customer/brand loyalty and further profits for them,
                with their clients having greater access to capital to then further invest in those traditional institutions which supported them,
                creating a positive feedback loop whereby their client&apos;s profits from cryptocurrencies are then reinvested in more traditional and stable vehicles offered by those institutions,
                such as TFSAs, ETFs, RRSPs or stocks.
                </p>
                
                <p class='note border border-info rounded'>While blockchain technologies pride themselves on anonymity (in theory),
                with all transactions being recorded publicly (in a decentralized, distributed ledger holding all accounts and transactions),
                through rudimentary powers of deduction by a forensic analyst or with the application of AI (and enough processing power),
                the public nature of the blockchain allows transaction histories of wallets to be easily monitored by anyone.
                Spending patterns can then be deduced using those data points (which are stored indefinitely on the blockchain).
                </p>
                
                <p>While in theory, a particular wallet address should not be tied to any specific person however,
                due to the public nature of most blockchains, it is posible using additional techniques (including correlation attacks),
                to reasonably associate an individual to a specific wallet address on a blockchain,
                with many companies now specialising in just that, in order to help regulators, law enforcement and governments thwart illegal activities,
                such as scams, money laundering oeprations or those seeking to violating/bypass international sanctions.

                is the best approach to avoid the latter.

                    <p>Blockchains maintain a complete transaction history, distributed across all machines participating on the network,
                    so that targeting a single node for exploitation, effectively renders common malicious techniques,
                    such as DDoS attacks, ineffective due to having too large of attack surface, making such techniques ineffective at worst and obsolete at best,
                    since disruption of any one network participant has little to no effect on the capacity of the network to operate as a whole,
                    combined with the distributed nature of the blockchain, any malicious actions on a single node will have no effect on the network as a whole,
                    with any blocks which are deemed to be invalid under the consensus mechanism discarded and ignored.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Additionally, since most blockchains require users to pay a gas fee in exchange for consuming network resources to process a transaction,
                    this renders all attempts at DDoS style attacks on a blockchain financially infeasible due to the immense cost of attempting to overwhelm all the nodes on the network through shear transaction volume,
                    with enough nodes and a high enough gas fee, this can easily become millions, if not billions, of dollars just to make a single transactional attempt to disrupt all nodes,
                    acting as a built-in deterent to prevent people (or bots) exploiting the network or its resources.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Nodes also have the ability to reject transactions if too many blocks are submitted or the size of a transaction&apos;s payload exceeds a maximunm allowable block-size limit.

                    <p>At its core, cryptocurrency blockchains are secured using cyptoygraphically secured transactions,
                    validated by a decentralized network using public/private key cryptography,
                    where only owners of a private key (which should never be shared with anyone for any reason) may send and sign transactions from their wallet,
                    while a public key (which is safely sharable with anyone) is required to receive transactions in the same manner messages may be encrypted/decrypted
                    using a public/prvate key pair using conventional cryptographic products such as OpenSSL (on which the HTTPS protocol is built).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Wallets addresses and their private/public keys on a network are generated using a unique private seed phrase (this should also never be shared with anyone for any reason),
                    which typically consits of 12 or 15 unique words (depending on the platform).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>This approach to distributed ledger development (and its other mechanics) also renders any attempt at "banning" cryptocurrency by a centralized government effectively moot,
                    since the physical nodes can be distributed literally anywhere across the globe or even the universe,
                    as seen with many previous attempt by some countries to ban Bitcoin, resulting in most nodes just simply be relocated to a jurisdiction where it is not banned,
                    with little or no impact on the network stabiltiy as a whole.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note border border-info rounded'>There are, however, other forms of attacks or security vulnerabilities on decentralized networks,
                    such as the infamous <b>51% attack</b>,
                    where if a single actor or group controls at least 51% of the nodes on any network,
                    they effectively control the consensus mechanism of that network,
                    and can unilaterally decide which transactions are valid and which are not.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><a href="">Front running</a> is another attack vector, where malicious nodes on a network fraudulently modify their internal clock or raise gas fees
                    so that transactions they process appear to happen before, or &quote;infront of&amp; other transactions which would have otherwise occured before the fronter&apos; transaction.
                    This can allow hostile actors, for example, to purchase all the tokens of an ICO or NFT launch before it actually happens by precalculating the address a contract will be deployed to then submitting transactions timestamped 15 seconds before the rest of the network,
                    causing all the front-runner&apos;s transactions to be finalized before anyone else has the opportunity to interact with the contract.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note border border-info rounded'>As mentioned previously, malicious nodes caught engaging in front-running on a network can be penalized by having it's staked slashed, causing its operator and investors to permanently lose their stake on a PoS network.
                    </p>
                    
                    <!--p><a href="">Double spend attack</a> is a specific attack vector where a single transaction is validated twice,
                    resulting in uninteded spending of funds. This can happen primarily in conjunction with a 51% attack,
                    or simply by spamming the network with signed transactions which do not implement nonces.
                    In this case, a nonce is used to ensure only a singe transaction is carried out atomically on a network,
                    where a transaction with the current nonce is accepted to be processed, with any other value being denied,
                    effectively gaurenteeing a transaction will be execued only once, only if the nonce logic is coded properly.

                    <p>Stablecoins are less volatile than conventional cryptocurrencies, due to being pegged (typically) to the US Dollar.

                    <p>The only thing worse than a centralized blockchain is one that&apos;s controlled by an authoritarian government without public accountability and absolute control over all transactions and nodes on the network,
                    much like how a privately owned Federal Central Bank (usually) claims unillateral control over prining and distributing fiat today at their discretion, with no regard for inflation, or the welling being of common people,
                    while issuing unlimited funds to their corrupt cohorts and other irresponsible institutions as they deem fit, on demand, without any public oversight,
                    despite the currency of a nation being a public good, which should not be under the control of any single entity,
                    since the policies around that assest has implications for all of society.
                    This effectively deprives the people of a nation of the inhernet, sovreign democratic rights regarding having control over the public goods of their nation and its self-determination,
                    especially after the highly contravesial decision of the S.C.O.T.U.S. in <a hef="">Citizens Unitied</a>,
                    which federally established the policy of not ony recognizing corporations as people but also
                    that the fiat of the nation was directly tied to the ability to express the rights of free speech/expression and voting enshrined in the Constitution.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>However, the primary flaw with this logic, aside from the glaring fact corporations are not issued birth or death certificates, nor can a corporation hold public office,
                    and they are treated very differently under various laws throughout all levels of governemnt, including taxation and zoning (which apply starkly distinct limitations between people and corporations).
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>For example, if a corporation commits crimes, it can avoid all liability simply by dissolving and liquidating their assets,
                    despite the people who commited those crimes (on behalf of the corporation) still very much exist.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Next time you get a ticket or face charges in court,
                    try convincing the judge they can&apos;t enforce the charges because the legal entity who commited the crimes has been dissolved and see how well that works out as a private citizen (<i>please do <b class='text-danger'>not</b> actually try this #NotLegalAdvice</i>).

                    <p>However, this is not the most <b class='text-danger'>egregious</b> implications of Citizens Unitied because if (according to the S.C.O.T.U.S.)
                    money is, infact, repressentative of people&apos;s ability to enact their Constitutional rights,
                    that means systemic poverty is explicitly and in no uncertain terms, an unlawful denial of those Constitutional rights,
                    thus becoming government sponsored <b class='text-danger'>slavery</b>,

                    <p>The <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a> is &quot;a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol&quot; built around of idea of making the internet more open, decentralized and censorship resistent.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Where the modern internet relies on a centralized DNS provider to check and resolve a domain name to an IP address,
                    which then a centralized server then sends the client&apos;s web browser the requested page, the IPFS does things a little differently.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>Similar to the concept of torrent seeders on a peer-to-peer network, IPFS content is fragmented and distributed across all peer nodes which make up its decentralized network.
                    When a request is made for content, typically the nodes closest to the request&apos;ers location are queried first and the content is reassembled from the chunks, on demand.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>To ensure data integrity and that the requested data is the exact resouce requested,
                    IPFS uses a cryptographically secure one-way hashing algorithm for content on the network. This hash is then used to access a specific resource.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>This is called content based addressing and allows each unique resource on the network to resolve to a unique resource identifier,
                    since the foundational concept of hashing is that each unique binary payload can and should (theoretically)
                    result in an equally unique hash which can only be produced by that payload and only that payload.</p>
                    
                    <p>Not only is this safe, it is also fast, since rather than having to wait for a single server to send a response from the other side of the world, in orbit or even potentially from another planet (hence the name),
                    the nearest nodes on the network which store the requested content are queried for the desired content,
                    while also the unique hash used to access resources ensures only the resource which corresponds to that unique hash is returned.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class='note border border-info rounded'>Because the IPFS resolves the content stored on it by a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm,
                    not only is it guarenteed that a unique URL exists for any unique piece of content and that URL will resolve to the same content every time but also the integrity of that data is also guarenteed,
                    since if the underlying data changes, so will the corresponding hash, giving a completely different URL.

                    where participants can negotiate storage contracts with data providers (storage providers are rewarded with FIL, paid by data providers) for dedicated storage space on the network.
