                            <p>I'm the proud father of a bright and charismatic son.
                            </p>
                            <p>My son is the single greatest inspiration in my work.
                            Knowing that one day he will be able to use and learn from the software I develop,
                            at the very least he will have fun playing games specially built just for him.
                            <p>
                            <p>
                            Aside from his general fascination with his father's computer,
                            he loves to help bug-test code I'm working on by just bashing keys until his heart's content.
                            As a result, I have set up some examples where he can just push random keys and get immediate results on screen.

                            <p>While growing up in the 90's tech boom, even though I was too young for a computer,
                            I still had an SNES and Sega Genesis that were played at every opportunity,
                            with classics including Sonic, Mortal Combat, Road Rash and Super Mario World and Yoshi's Island.
                            </p>
                            <p>Our Sega had a neat little feature where it would only play games when it was upside down and propped up against the wall at a specific angle.
                            Boy, those were the days.
                            </p>
                            <p>It wouldn't be until roughly 10 when the family got its first desktop.
                            That would start a passion for tech and gaming which continues to grow today.
                            </p>
                            <p>Even though most of my time was spent playing solitaire, minesweeper and doodling in MS paint,
                            eventually I would buy my first PC game, Sid Meier's Civilization 4.
                            After installing it, I played a marathon session of over 48 consecutive hours,
                            and have been obsessed with the franchise ever since.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            It wouldn't be until high school where my interest on-line gaming really took over,
                            specifically with MMORG's such as Guild Wars and World of Warcraft,
                            after buying my first custom built rig for gaming.

                        <p>Joining Air Cadets when I was old enough,
                        I didn't learn leadership, discipline, or self reliance there,
                        those qualities I already possessed were only strengthened,
                        providing the foundation for the driven, entrepreneurial attitude I have today.
                        </p>
                        <p>By the age of 15 I was working a consistent part-time job while still attending high school, cadets and actively participating in extra curricular sports such a Basketball and Track and Field.
                        By then having made the rank of sergeant, I was regularly teaching classes on survival, drill, the principles of flight and related topics.
                        </p>
                        <p>At age 17, I received my private pilots license, through cadets before I had my G1.
                        While in high school, I went to OFSSA three times for discuss and shot put,
                        consistently placing in the top 6 across the province each year.

                        <h4>College</h4>
                        <!--p>Shortly after moving to attend a course on video game design and development,
                        my life changed dramatically.
                        </p>
                        <p>Within the first few months there, I had developed a C++ poker hashing algorithm and evaluator as my first major coding project.
                        When finished, my project outperformed those of my peers, as well as that of my instructor,
                        which he would eagerly brag about to his colleagues, earning me recognition across campuses.
                        </p>
                        <p>The game implemented the 5 most common types of poker games,
                        leveraging fundamental principles of number theory and static programming techniques to execute,
                        analyze and compare hands of cards at a nearly instant time complexity.
                        This project is still my proudest accomplishment from that time,
                        however the project source is not planned to be available any time soon.
                        </p>
                        <p>After that, my most notable projects were developing prototypes for a 3D DirectX-10 role playing game which loaded levels and basic models (saved as markup) and had a primitive combat system and UI (which would later result in the basis for an entire graphics engine),
                        and two C# XNA titles which included a mincraft-esque farming simulator with real time xml editing tools (for level development) and a space-flight shooter featuring upgrade-able weapons of various types (including laser cannons, photon-torpedoes and proximity mines) for Xbox 360.
                        </p>
                        <p>I also attended the Great Canadian App-athon in 2011 and 2012,
                        which was a 72 hour coding contest involving all colleges and universities across Canada.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>By this point I was nearing the end of my college career and regularly working 16-18 hours a day (sometimes even periods of 48 hours or more) to meet my school work load,
                        while also pursuing my own side projects,
                        which would include an interest in cryptography,
                        but more importantly I would teach myself Python in the hopes of adapting a bulky and cumbersome C++ template meta-programming markup language serialization library into a more elegant solution in Python.
                        After completing that, the goal then was to write a C++ application with the Python interpreter embedded within it,
                        to leverage the added flexibility and modularity of Python.
                        </p>
                        <p>The advent of a functioning markup language parser lead to the formalization of a written standard, that I personally developed and maintain to address many issues I had personally with both xml and json formats. I would then go on to include these component with my larger 3D Direct-X engine to facilitate serialization of dynamic game objects created through the level editor.

                        </p>
                        <p>During the internship I also supported myself through working full time at a temp agency.
                        This required working 16 hours a day at 2 separate jobs for four months straight until I was hired to continue working as an iOS developer.

                        <p>As it was a small start-up, I was the sole developer working on their projects (with the owner/CEO being the artist),
                        I played all roles from lead developer (including writing shell script build tools and photoshop scripts),
                        to QA tester and Research and Development.
                        I was also responsible for all aspects of the life cycle of multiple built target applications which implemented a diverse toolchain.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Within my first year, roughly 10 applications had either been released or updated,
                            to which the most successful app having over 3.5 million downloads and continues to be highly successful.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Unfortunately, near the end of my employment with Sky Orchard Studios, I would suffer a devastating personal loss,
                        With all of my personal hardware being stolen from my apartment.
                        This effectively resulted in the loss of all my projects, notes, source code, examples and backups of my entire life's work up to that point,
                        causing a devastating professional set back, which, to this day, still has not been fully recovered from.
                        </p>

                        <p>Going back to the temp agency, after the contract expired, I would take on various manual labour roles.
                        </p>
                        <p>After several months of factory work,
                        I would finally get the opportunity to recover from the theft of my hardware,
                        being able to purchase a laptop for a job as a web developer.
                        </p>
                        <p>At that point I quickly taught myself javascript, html, css, php, and mySQL while on the job.</p>
                        <p>While there I worked closely with 1 other dedicated developer and a small group of and 2-5 interns updating an Actionscript based web application to HTML5.
                        </p>
                        <p>As a senior team member, I primarily supervised the interns assisting in their tasks,
                        while simultaneously working on my own.
                        </p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, the company would dissolve before the product could launch.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>Afterward, I went on to find employment at my former college, TriOS, teaching the very course I had once taken.
                        </p>
                        <p>Shortly after beginning my new job, I became a father of a amazing son.
                        </p>
                        <p>While at TriOS, I worked 10-16 hours teaching 2 separate classes a day and was responsible for managing groups between 4-12 students at a time.
                        Lectures included the foundational concepts of computer programming, software development, video game design and the software production life-cycle,
                        with the course's primary focus being on Unity/C#, Xcode/Swift, Win32/DirectX-11, and mobile/web development using HTML and javascript development.
                        </p>

                        <p>In my free time, I began further expanded my knowledge of graphics programming by developing exciting,
                        easy to use, interactive examples and tools to help with visualization of abstract rendering concepts,
                        while also working towards building a minimalist graphics engine for the web.
                        </p>
                        <p>After working a year at TriOS, I decided to leave to be a stay-at-home father to raise and teach my, by then, 1 year old son,
                        while my spouse went back to both college and work after taking time off and we waited for our son to be accepted into a childcare program.

                        <h4>Recently</h4>
                        <!--p>As of today, roughly 8 years after graduating college,
                        I am fluent in over 10 programming, scripting, shading or markup languages and
                        recently began teaching myself Solidity, for programming cryptocurrency smart-contracts on the Ethereum blockchain,
                        as well as TensorFlow for Machine Learning,
                        React for web UI development and NodeJS for back-end server development.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, with the many projects currently under development across multiple platforms (see projects page),
                        it has become quite time consuming for a single developer to work on and maintain all of them (even with appropriate software tools for minimizing workflow overhead),
                        thus I have opened up several open-source repositories for several of the more mature projects,
                        in hopes of attracting additional interest in my work,
                        while also allowing me to focus on younger and more ambitious projects.
